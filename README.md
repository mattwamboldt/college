# College Projects

Where it all began! (Minus some dabbling with Macromedia Flash in highschool)

These projects are all committed as they were when I started my journey as a programmer in college. Only changes made are to get them to build on a current system.

## Releases/Running
All of these projects have executables that are distributed in the releases section. The only exceptions are the Capstone project and Networking Lib.

Most can be run from command line or by double clicking the executable. If a given project requires special instructions it will be included in the relevant section.

## Year 1 - Visual Basic
That's right. I started with VB.Net. The horror!

### Text Editor
### Heroless War (BattleShip)

## Year 2 - C++
### Tic Tac Toe
### Doodlebugs vs Ants
### Maze Solver
### Merge Sorter
### Spell Checker

## Year 2 - C#
### Console Chat
### Network Lib
### March of Doom (Game Project)

## Capstone Project - PromoGuru
This was the final project, an online product order management system. It was done as part of a group using several of the architectural patterns taught. It contains a database, business and frontend layers, test cases, and a WinForm app.

I recall having to work on a large portion of it but have no idea which parts. As such I've no idea how to get it running in modern Visual Studio without rewriting parts of it in something like .Net Core. To avoid losing the archival nature of this repo and changing too much I've left it as it was.
